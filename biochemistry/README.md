# Clinically Necessary Biochemistry for the MCAT

A clinical reasoning framework for answering MCAT biochemistry questions by mechanism, not memorization.

**Goal:** Use core physiological principles to **eliminate ≥2 answers immediately** and select the **most consistent clinical mechanism**, even under uncertainty.

---

## 0. Essential Amino Acid Functional Groups (Clinical hooks)
**Basic / positively charged (at pH 7):** Lys, Arg, His  
• DNA interaction and catalytic sites; enriched in DNA-binding proteins and active sites capable of acid–base catalysis.  
**Acidic / negatively charged:** Asp, Glu  
• Salt bridges, acid–base catalysis; phosphomimetics for Ser/Thr/Tyr.  
**Polar uncharged:** Ser, Thr, Tyr (phosphorylation); Cys (disulfides); Asn/Gln (amide specificity).  
**Hydrophobic:** Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, Met, Trp, Ala, Tyr → membrane insertion and core packing.

**Charge-change rule (pH 7):**  
Acidic = −1; Basic = +1; Neutral = 0 → **largest net change occurs when swapping acidic ↔ basic (eg, Glu ↔ Lys).**

---

## Protein Secondary Structure (must-know elimination)
• α-helices and β-sheets are stabilized by **backbone** H-bonds; **side chains do not** define secondary structure.  
**Rule:** If an option claims side-chain bonds stabilize secondary structure → **eliminate**.

---

## 1. Enzymes = Drug Kinetics (clinical reasoning)
**Km = affinity; Vmax = capacity.**  
**Inhibition patterns:**  
Competitive: Km ↑, Vmax same  
Noncompetitive: Km same, Vmax ↓  
Uncompetitive: Km ↓, Vmax ↓  
**Clinical hook:** Predict drug–enzyme interactions and lab curves (eg, competitive inhibitors shift Km without changing Vmax).

---

## 2. Metabolism as ICU Physiology
**Fed (insulin):** ↑ glycolysis, ↓ gluconeogenesis.  
**Key rule:** Net glucose catabolism is driven by **inhibiting gluconeogenic enzymes**, not by directly inhibiting glycolysis.  
**Irreversible steps (large −ΔG):** Hexokinase/Glucokinase, PFK‑1, Pyruvate kinase → **require bypasses in gluconeogenesis**.

---

## 3. Glycogen Breakdown (clinical)
Glycogen phosphorylase → G1P; Debranching enzyme handles α‑1,6; Phosphoglucomutase G1P ⇄ G6P.  
**Rule:** Release is **phosphorylated monomers**, not free glucose (in muscle).

---

## 4. Fat Metabolism: Lipolysis vs β‑Oxidation (clinical)
**Lipolysis (adipose):** Triglyceride → **3 fatty acids + glycerol** (hormone sensitive).  
**β‑Oxidation (mitochondria):** Fatty acids → **acetyl‑CoA + NADH + FADH₂** → TCA/ETC.  
**Rule:** “Fat oxidation” refers to **fatty acid oxidation** products (acetyl‑CoA, NADH, FADH₂); **glycerol release is lipolysis**, not oxidation.  
**Stoichiometry note:** Glycerophospholipid hydrolysis yields **2 fatty acids + 1 glycerol** → [FA] = **2×** [glycerol] at completion.

---

## 5. Membrane Proteins & Transport (clinical)
Transmembrane helices are **hydrophobic**; extra‑/cytosolic domains are **charged/polar**.  
**Rule:** Hydrophobic AA enrichment suggests membrane spanning segments.

---

## 6. ATP Requires Magnesium (clinical)
Mg²⁺ stabilizes ATP for **kinases, polymerases, and ATP‑binding** reactions.  
**Rule:** Hypomagnesemia impairs ATP‑dependent enzymes; Mg²⁺ is **structural**, not allosteric.

---

## 7. Protein Folding & Disulfides (clinical)
• **Disulfide bonds require oxidation**; reducing agents (eg, DTT) **break** them.  
• **Anfinsen principle:** The **primary sequence encodes folding**; activity recovery after denaturation implies correct refolding from the sequence.  
• Monomeric proteins lack **quaternary** structure.  
**Elimination wording:** Oxidizing agents **stabilize folded/native structure** (by forming disulfides); they do **not “stimulate” folding**.

---

## 8. Peptide Bond Hydrolysis (clinical lab logic)
Peptide bond hydrolysis is **thermodynamically favorable** but **kinetically slow** without proteases (high activation barrier).  
**Rule:** Denaturants disrupt **noncovalent** interactions; peptide bonds remain intact unless proteolysis occurs.

---

## 9. High‑Energy Molecules & Hydrolysis Factors (clinical energetics)
| Molecule | Dominant stabilization after hydrolysis |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| ATP | Resonance + relief of charge–charge repulsion |
| Creatine phosphate | **Resonance only** (no tautomerization; minimal repulsion) |
| PEP | Resonance + **keto–enol tautomerization** |
**Rule:** If “tautomerization” is cited for creatine → **eliminate**.

---

## 10. ΔG & Reversibility (pathway navigation)
**Reversible reactions:** **ΔG ≈ 0**; direction flips with substrate/product levels; **same enzyme** catalyzes both directions.  
**Irreversible reactions:** **Large −ΔG**, forward only; reverse needs **bypass enzyme**.  
**Clinical hooks:** Inferring bypass steps in gluconeogenesis; identifying spontaneous cyclizations as irreversible.

---

## 11. Nitrogen Disposal & Urea Cycle (clinical)
**Source of urea:** Amino acid deamination → **ammonia → urea (liver)**.  
**Transamination flow:** Amino group → **α‑ketoglutarate → glutamate** → oxidative deamination → ammonia → urea.  
**Rules:**  
• If tracing nitrogen labels, expect **glutamate before urea**.  
• **BUN** reflects protein catabolism and renal clearance; altered by liver failure (urea synthesis) and kidney dysfunction (excretion).

---

## 12. Data Interpretation Rules (critical on exams)
• No membrane → **no electrochemical gradients** or ETC coupling.  
• **Sigmoidal** curves → cooperativity/allostery.  
• In bar charts, prioritize **rank order** over absolute values unless units or scales demand otherwise.

---

## Elimination Playbook (apply fast)
1) Side chains do **not** stabilize secondary structure.  
2) Monomeric protein → **no quaternary** structure.  
3) Oxidation forms **disulfides** → stabilizes **folded** state; “stimulate folding” wording → **eliminate**.  
4) Peptide bonds intact after denaturation → **kinetic barrier**, not lack of water/GTP.  
5) Lipolysis vs **fat oxidation**: glycerol release ≠ oxidation products (acetyl‑CoA, NADH, FADH₂).  
6) Glycerophospholipid hydrolysis products: **FA = 2× glycerol** at equal conversion.  
7) ΔG cues: **same enzyme both ways → ΔG ≈ 0**; described as irreversible → **large −ΔG**.  
8) Hydrolysis energetics: Assign correct factor per molecule (ATP, creatine phosphate, PEP).
