# Clinically Necessary Biochemistry for the MCAT  
*A clinical reasoning framework that converts biochemistry into ICU/OR physiology rather than memorization.*

This guide distills **the biochemistry required for ~80–90% of MCAT questions** into high-yield clinical mechanisms.  
It is designed for **rapid elimination of incorrect answer choices**, not encyclopedic recall.

> Goal: eliminate ≥2 answer choices immediately → ≥50% probability even under uncertainty.

---

## 0. Essential Amino Acid Functional Groups  
This is the **ONLY amino acid framework required** for MCAT reasoning.

### Basic / Positively Charged (DNA binding, catalysis)
- **Lysine (K)** — primary amine → Schiff base formation  
- **Arginine (R)** — guanidinium → strong ionic interactions  
- **Histidine (H)** — imidazole → proton shuttle near physiological pH  

**Rule:** DNA-binding peptides = **rich in Lys/Arg**

---

### Acidic / Negatively Charged
- **Aspartate (D), Glutamate (E)**  
  → acid–base catalysis, salt bridges  
- **Phosphomimetics:** Glu/Asp mimic phosphorylated Ser/Thr/Tyr

---

### Polar Uncharged
- **Ser, Thr, Tyr** — phosphorylation sites  
- **Cysteine** — disulfide bonds (oxidation-dependent)  
- **Asparagine, Glutamine** — amide specificity (NOT charged)

---

### Hydrophobic (Membrane & TM helices)
Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, Met, Trp, Ala, Tyr  

- Drive folding
- Stabilize membranes
- **Transmembrane helices = almost entirely hydrophobic AAs**

---

### Structural Specialties
- **Proline** — rigid, helix breaker  
  - Only amino acid with a **secondary amine**
- **Glycine** — flexible, turns, collagen

---

## 0.5 Essential Carbohydrate Structures (MCAT High-Yield)
- **Ribose (RNA, ATP) = pentofuranose**
- **Deoxyribose = pentofuranose**
- **Glucose = hexopyranose**

**Rule:**  
> Nucleotides → 5 carbons → furanose

---

## Protein Secondary Structure (Must-Know)
- **α-helices & β-sheets are stabilized by BACKBONE hydrogen bonds**
- Side chains do **not** stabilize secondary structure

**Elimination rule:**  
If answer mentions side-chain bonding → ❌

---

## 1. Enzymes = Drug Kinetics
**Km = affinity**  
**Vmax = capacity**

### Inhibition Patterns
| Type | Km | Vmax |
|---|---|---|
| Competitive | ↑ | same |
| Noncompetitive | same | ↓ |
| Uncompetitive | ↓ | ↓ |

---

### Cooperativity
- **Sigmoidal curve = cooperative binding**
- Seen in:
  - Hemoglobin
  - Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase
  - Allosteric enzymes

---

## 2. Metabolism = ICU Physiology

### Fed State (Insulin)
- ↑ glycolysis
- ↓ gluconeogenesis

**Key rule:**  
> Net glucose catabolism occurs by **inhibiting gluconeogenesis enzymes**, not glycolysis enzymes.

---

### Glycogen Breakdown
- **Glycogen phosphorylase** → releases G1P  
- **Debranching enzyme** → handles α-1,6 branches  
- **Phosphoglucomutase** → G1P ⇄ G6P (NOT monomer release)

---

### β-Oxidation (MCAT math rule)
- **# acetyl-CoA = carbons ÷ 2**
- No isomerization → fully saturated fatty acid

---

## 3. Membrane Proteins & Transport
- **Transmembrane helices = hydrophobic**
- **Extracellular/cytosolic domains = charged/polar**

---

## 4. ATP Requires Magnesium
- ATP binding
- Kinases
- Polymerases

Mg²⁺ stabilizes ATP (never allosteric).

---

## 5. Protein Folding & Disulfides
- **Disulfide bonds require oxidation**
- Oxidizing agents → ↑ dimerization
- Reducing agents (DTT) → break disulfides

---

## 6. Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis
- Built **C → N terminus**
- **Condensation reaction**
- **Water is released**

**Elimination rule:**  
Hydrolysis = breaking bonds  
Peptide synthesis = forming bonds → condensation

---

## 7. pI & Phosphorylation
- Adding phosphate → **adds negative charge**
- **pI decreases after phosphorylation**

---

## 8. Data Interpretation Rules (Critical)
- If membrane absent → no electrochemical gradient possible
- Sigmoidal activity curve → changing ligand affinity
- Bar charts: compare **order**, not magnitude

---

## Acknowledgment
This framework was refined using high-quality third-party practice materials, including **UWorld**, whose question design and explanations are invaluable for identifying MCAT-relevant reasoning patterns. No proprietary content is reproduced here.

---

## Final Principle
This is **clinical biochemistry**:
- Identify the system
- Eliminate impossible mechanisms
- Choose the most physiologically consistent answer
